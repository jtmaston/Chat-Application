# Chat Application backend
## What is this?
This is a backend for a simple chat application, able to transmit text and well... _text_
## How do I use it?
First, start the server by running Server.py. Currently the application only works locally, but that can be adjusted later. 
Then, run two instances of Client.py and set names accordingly. Happy chatting!
## Limitations
Currently, you have to enter a _valid_ destination username. Not doing so can (and will) cause
strange behaviour.
## Still here?
